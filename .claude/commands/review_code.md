# Review Code

Review code changes against requirements/specs for a Python package (no UI).

## VARIABLES

spec_file: $1 (optional - defaults to finding spec from branch name or recent changes)

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Check current git branch: `git branch --show-current`
- Get recent changes: `git diff origin/master --stat` and `git log origin/master..HEAD --oneline`
- If spec_file not provided, look for matching spec in `specs/` based on branch name or recent commits
- Read the spec file to understand requirements
- Review the code changes against the spec:
  - Run tests: `uv run pytest -v`
  - Check types: `uv run pyright` (if configured)
  - Review implementation matches spec requirements
- Document any issues found
