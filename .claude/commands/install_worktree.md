# Install Worktree

This command sets up an isolated worktree environment with custom port configuration.

## PARAMETERS
- Worktree path: {0}
- Backend port: {1}
- Frontend port: {2}

## READ
- [.adw.yaml] (from parent repo) - Source of truth for backend/frontend dirs and scripts (see `app.*`)
- [.env.sample] (from parent repo)
- [<backend_dir from [.adw.yaml]>/.env.sample] (from parent repo, if present)
- [.mcp.json] (from parent repo)
- [playwright-mcp-config.json] (from parent repo)

## STEPS

1. **Navigate to worktree directory**
   ```bash
   cd {0}
   ```

2. **Create port configuration file**
   Create [.ports.env] with:
   ```
   BACKEND_PORT={1}
   FRONTEND_PORT={2}
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:{1}
   ```

3. **Copy and update .env files**
   - Copy [.env] from parent repo if it exists
   - Append [.ports.env] contents to [.env]
   - Copy [<backend_dir from [.adw.yaml]>/.env] from parent repo if it exists
   - Append [.ports.env] contents to [<backend_dir from [.adw.yaml]>/.env]

4. **Copy and configure MCP files**
   - Copy [.mcp.json] from parent repo if it exists
   - Copy [playwright-mcp-config.json] from parent repo if it exists
   - These files are needed for Model Context Protocol and Playwright automation
   
   After copying, update paths to use absolute paths:
   - Get the absolute worktree path: `WORKTREE_PATH=$(pwd)`
   - Update [.mcp.json]:
     - Find the line containing ["./playwright-mcp-config.json"]
     - Replace it with ["${WORKTREE_PATH}/playwright-mcp-config.json"]
     - Use a JSON-aware tool or careful string replacement to maintain valid JSON
   - Update [playwright-mcp-config.json]:
     - Find the line containing ["dir": "./videos"]
     - Replace it with ["dir": "${WORKTREE_PATH}/videos"]
     - Create the videos directory: `mkdir -p ${WORKTREE_PATH}/videos`
   - This ensures MCP configuration works correctly regardless of execution context

5. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd <backend_dir from [.adw.yaml]> && uv sync --all-extras
   ```

6. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd <frontend_dir from [.adw.yaml]> && bun install
   ```

7. **Setup database**
   ```bash
   cd {0} && ./<reset_db_script from [.adw.yaml]>
   ```

## ERROR_HANDLING
- If parent [.env] files don't exist, create minimal versions from [.env.sample] files
- Ensure all paths are absolute to avoid confusion

## REPORT
- List all files created/modified (including MCP configuration files)
- Show port assignments
- Confirm dependencies installed
- Note any missing parent [.env] files that need user attention
- Note any missing MCP configuration files
- Show the updated absolute paths in:
  - [.mcp.json] (should show full path to [playwright-mcp-config.json])
  - [playwright-mcp-config.json] (should show full path to videos directory)
- Confirm videos directory was created
